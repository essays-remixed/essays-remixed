##WHAT 

Essays are the physical manifestations of the most important thoughts and ideas that people have had. People write essays to structure thought, to dissemenate knowedge, and to convince others of their viewpoints. However, ideas evolve, facts change, and some ideas need the minds of more than one person to fully come to fruition. 

Essays-remixed is an attempt to fix this. 

As such, Essays-remixed is a collection of influentual and powerful essays, that have been modified, tweaked and (hopefully) improved to better serve the needs of the future.
